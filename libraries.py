Open AI refers to the fact that Python and all of the associated libraries in the predictive analytics community is free. The open means open source and the AI means artificial intelligence. 

Libraries are simply code we can import into Python to extend the functionality of the language. 

High level in programming language vernacular means the code is more human readable. 


Libraries:
# Pandas 
# Keras
# Numpy: manipulate arrays
# Scikit-Learn: build model
# NLTK: for text mining and natural language processing. 

What can I do right now to put myself in a position to become a data scientist or machine learning engineer?

Become a voracious learner of all things machine learning. 
Enter many Kaggle competitions. It doesn't matter where you place. 
Find data that isn't common and create and publish your models to github. 
Learn Python and the associated libraries for machine learning. 
Create a blog about your learning experience and about data science. 
This is a great free resource: http://datasciencemasters.org/

Excel vs Machine Learning:
    - A spreadsheet would be a dataset
    - A row is an observation
    - A column is an attribute
    
Machine Learning works with CSV files. If it is supervised it means that we have a dataset to work with.


Target variable = what we try to predict using all of the previous attributes in our dataset (TRAINING DATA)

Supervised: there is a dataset
Unsupervised: there is not dataset

Steps:
1) Get Raw Data
2) Clean Data 80% of the workday
3) Build Model 10%
4) Predict: output


Core Elements in Pandas:
1) Series: a 1D range
2) Dataframe
3) Index

NumPy: helps with scientific computing in Python, allowing to generate multidimensional array objects
We use the convention np.array() to craft an array. 

SciKit-Learn: focused on modeling data

Accuracy
Accuracy is perhaps the most intuitive performance measure. It is simply the ratio of correctly predicted observations.  Accuracy is not shown in our output but you'll see it used everywhere. 

Precision
Precision looks at the ratio of correct positive observations.

Recall
Recall is also known as sensitivity or true positive rate. Itâ€™s the ratio of correctly predicted positive events.

F1 Score
The F1 Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account.


The classifier is fit on the data and then predictions are made on the training data.

The very basic SciKit-Learn model building process is: 
Importing the library objects you need.  (the model, data... etc)
Load our data (supervised learning models)
Define the model (our models was Support Vector Machines)
We fit the model to our data (tell the algorithm what our data looks like)
Predict
